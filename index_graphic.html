        <h3>Expectations: To show support for the citizens of Hong Kong Against Chinese oppression.</h3>
        <h3>Inspiration: Citizens of Hong Kong protest against the extradition to China bill in 2019 favoring their own freedoms. </h3>
        <p>I created a photo representing the clash between the citizens of Hong Kong and the Chinese state-sponsored militarized police force. I distorted the blended imagery for the feeling of unnerving and to show the discomfort and disarray of the protestors. I show the discontent of the people in my photo with distortion, vibration, and haze. One of the images I blended in the final photo is of the barbed wire that separates Hong Kong from China to emphasize that Hong Kong is a culture and a people of its own distanced from china by a century of feined occupation.</p>

        <h1>Logo Design</h1>
        <h2>Role: Graphic Designer</h2>
        <h3>Expectations: Customer wants original yellow color and Lil House of Donuts name.</h3>
        <p>The customer was an employee for Lil Orbits Donut Shop who had decided to branch off and start their own local donut shop. They wanted to keep to the original yellow color used at Lil Orbits. With no additional guidance, the rest of the design was up to my creative license.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="textandimages_logo">
        <div id="text2_logo">
            <p>I began by looking up House of Donuts and found an existing “Original House of Donuts” and took inspiration from their logo. I enjoyed the House shape that was integrated with the company name. The main difference I wanted to give the logo was more simplistic straight lines balancing the cartoonish fun donut- the emphasis being the delicious- mouthwatering donut to draw people's attention. </p>

        <div id="text3_logo">
            <p>I maintained the yellow background from 'Lil Orbits' for the customer. The main draw is an abundance of pink to accent the feel of the yellow with a hint of blue to make the donut pop out towards the viewer.</p>
            <p>After the first iteration of the Lil House of Donuts logo, I went back into it and defined everything more with blue to really emphasize the company name and accent the donut a little more. </p>

    <div id="textandimages2_logo">
        <div id="text3_logo">
            <p>The logo was to be displayed in the center of the Alderwood mall food court, so by adding the blue, I gave it a more stand-out and attractive view to draw the customer in among the other vendors.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate how the logo would look, I made a mock-up photo for the customer. </p>

        <h1>Beer of Perfection</h1>
        <h2>Role: Product Designer, UX Researcher, and Graphic Designer</h2>
        <h3>Expectations: Package a beer with great convenience and taste.</h3>
        <p>This product concept was my submission for my final in Production Design at Eastern Washington University, a cumulation of my effort across the entire quarter. The project goal was to design both a vessel for beer as well as packaging, logos, and branding surrounding the container. To properly research my product and packaging design I thought I would start at the source - I took a trip to some local breweries. I toured five facilities, from brewing and canning to labeling and marketing, including a one on one Q and A with several brewery owners. After an additional educational trip to Total Wine to look at the variety of labeling and packaging, I took pictures, sketched ideas, and took notes to guide my direction. </p>

    </div>

    <div id="text1_beer">
        <p>I decided on a reusable glass jar with replaceable lids similar to typical cans. This would allow consumers the ability to refill with any beer at any brewhouse without having to commit to the full volume of a growler. The glass achieves a few things; it is the smoothest and least reactive material, allowing for washing and reuse while maintaining the taste and integrity of each new beer, further the glass has a certain appealing texture in the hand that gives the consumer tactile satisfaction. The decision for reusable metal pop-tops is also multifaceted; they are cheap, easy to mass-produce, and recyclable while still granting the customer the satisfying 'CSHH' of cracking open a cold one. </p>

    <div id="text1_beer">
        <p>Once I knew the direction the beer packaging was going, I started developing the prototype. This process took most of my time as iteration after iteration there was always something more to improve upon. Whether a better design that didn't require adhesives or a more comfortable handle, I recognized that usability also needed to be factored just as much as design. One of the main challenges that I faced was designing a lock hinge for the bottom of the box that would hold the weight of the beer. My solution was to use origami paper folding techniques to enhance strength. </p>

    <div id="text2_beer">
        <p>One of the goals for my packaging design was to reflect both the utility and practicality of the product as well as reflect the draft-brewery capital of the US and my home – the Pacific Northwest. I drew inspiration for the packaging from my surroundings - to reflect the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p id="quote">The rugged high peaks, the blowing evergreens, and the abundance of majestic flowing water.</p>
        <p>I wanted it to stand out from the more common black and brown color schemes, I chose a bold blue to match the cool environment. Through my research about why beer containers were designed to block most light, I discovered that the light from the sun could chemically damage the beer, degrading the taste and quality. The blue design of the packaging and container not only adds to the aesthetic, but blue is one of the most prominent wavelengths of light the sun produces, allowing my container to block the vast majority of sunlight and keeping the beer fresh.</p>

    <h2>Role: Graphic Designer and Production Artist</h2>
    <h3>Expectations: Deliver compelling ideas and develop those ideas into tangible design solutions to meet client goals and objectives.</h3>
    <p>I work closely with customers to capture their ideas and create designs and artwork. I manage approvals, handle customer inquiries and quotes, provide information about products and pricing, and troubleshoot customer issues and concerns. I am also responsible for all aspects of sign design and manufacturing including design, proofs, vinyl cutting and application, digital printing, and assembly.</p>
    <p>A large part of my efforts go towards graphic design, I create and/or modify company logos and aesthetics from ideation to completion. Depending on if the design is being used for a vehicle wrap, large outdoor banner, business cards, wall murals, window decals, etc. I adjust the composition to ensure print readiness.</p>
    <p>I produce comps, mock-ups, resizing, editing, revising rounds, and grammatical proofing of collateral. I keep a keen eye out for the effects of color, font, typeface, photograph, and overall layout and to ensure the elements communicate the desired creative concepts. I deliver compelling ideas and develop those ideas into tangible design solutions to meet client goals and objectives. I maintain electronic archives, filing systems, and image libraries of marketing materials.</p>
